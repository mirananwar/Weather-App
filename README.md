# Weather-App
An IOS weather app which displays the temperature, weather condition, what the temperature actually feels like and wind speed (using API) - the features that I think are most relevant. Implemented the MVC pattern.

In order to run the app:
1. Create an account to generate an API key from: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
2. Insert your API key in the "WeatherManager.swift" file under the Model folder where it says "insert-api-key"
